## Minimal 30 Queens

30 Queens is a version of the [N-Queens puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)
on a 30x30 chess board with 30 queens. The object is to calculate
positions for all 30 queens such that no queen is attacking any other
queen.


### History

[Aaron Brooks](http://github.com/abrooks) and I were graduates from
[Taylor University](http://www.taylor.edu) and in 2003 we were both
working at HP. A former CS professor at Taylor issued a challenge to
his class and also to former alumni to create a fast 30 queens solver.

We worked on the problem individually in our free time, but eventually
decided it would be more fun to collaborate on a version that was
still fast but as small as possible.

This is a result of that collaborative messing around.


### Try it out

    make
    ./h


### How does it work?

Hah! That would be too easy. Use this as a learning opportunity and
figure it out yourself (without looking in `spoilers_and_historical`
or the commit history of `h.c`).

I can promise that if you figure it out without cheating you will
learn a whole lot about not just the C language (and how it can be
terribly abused), but also many other aspects of how modern computers
work (a list of what you will learn would be 90% of the answer).
